    <h2>Overview of JavaScript</h2>
    <p class="details">JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for front-end web development. It empowers developers to create interactive and dynamic content on websites, enhancing user experiences. As a client-side scripting language, JavaScript executes directly in the user's browser, enabling the manipulation of the <span style="color:var(--brand-color)">Document Object Model (DOM)</span> and the creation of responsive and engaging web applications.</p>
 <div class="read-more-message" style="display: none;">
      <h2>More on JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a dynamic language that brings web pages to life. It's the powerhouse behind interactive and responsive websites, enabling developers to create engaging user experiences effortlessly.</p>
    
      <p>One of JavaScript's superpowers lies in its speed as it executes quickly in your web browser, ensuring a seamless user interface. This speed, combined with its versatility, allows developers to achieve a wide array of functionalities, from dynamic content updates to handling user inputs with finesse.</p>
    
      <p>JavaScript isn't limited to just websites; its capabilities extend to 3D graphics with libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, making your website visually stunning. If you're venturing into app development, JavaScript plays a key role through <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>, allowing you to build cross-platform mobile applications efficiently.</p>
    
      <p>For those fascinated by physics simulations, JavaScript has you covered with <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a>. It provides a wonderful platform for creating realistic physics interactions in web applications.</p>
      
<p>JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

  <strong><h3>Basic to Advanced JavaScript:</h3></strong> Before jumping into frameworks like Three.js and React Native, it's crucial to understand the foundation of JavaScript. Start with basics like creating and using variables, understanding different types of data, and how to make decisions in your code.
</p>

<h3>Key JavaScript Topics to Master:</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Get comfortable creating boxes (variables) to store information and learn about the different types of information you can put in those boxes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Functions:</strong> Explore the idea of using reusable sets of instructions called functions, making your code more organized and efficient.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Control Flow and Error Handling:</strong> Learn how to make your code do different things based on certain conditions, and how to deal with errors when they pop up.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Loops and Iteration:</strong> Understand how to make your code repeat certain tasks without having to write the same thing over and over.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Objects and Classes:</strong> Dive into the world of organizing your information in a structured way, like putting related things together in a box.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> Master handling multiple tasks at the same time without slowing down your code, which is like doing several things at once without getting stuck.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Closures:</strong> Explore how to keep certain information private in your code and create little safe spaces for your functions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Understand how JavaScript can change what you see on a webpage, like updating text or images without refreshing the whole page.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ES6 Features:</strong> Discover new tools introduced in JavaScript to make your code shorter and more expressive, like using arrow functions and simpler ways to write text.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Modular JavaScript:</strong> Learn how to organize your code into neat sections, making it easier to work on and understand.
</p>
